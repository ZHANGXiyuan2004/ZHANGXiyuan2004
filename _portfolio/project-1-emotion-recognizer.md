* [cite_start]**Role:** First Principal Investigator [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Duration:** Dec 2023 - Aug 2024 [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Advisor:** Prof. Ding Zheng (UESTC) [cite: 20]

### Description
[cite_start]This project involved the development of a wearable emotion detection device that recognizes emotions by analyzing speech and EEG signals[cite: 21]. [cite_start]The entire system is powered by custom-fabricated flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices[cite: 21].

### My Contributions
* [cite_start]**Model Architecture:** Designed and implemented the complete model architecture[cite: 24]. [cite_start]This included a dual-modal binding mechanism to process speech signals and a Transformer-based network to fuse modal-invariant and modal-specific features[cite: 24]. [cite_start]For EEG data, I designed a preprocessing method using wavelet transforms to convert signals into time-frequency image patches for a Vision Transformer (ViT)[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Device Fabrication:** Fabricated the flexible OPV devices using a PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction as the active layer, achieving a power conversion efficiency of over 12.39%[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Project Leadership:** Was responsible for team formation, overall system design, writing and illustrating the research paper, and presenting the results[cite: 24].

### Outcomes
* [cite_start]Accepted for oral presentation at the ICDT 2025 conference (first author)[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]Awarded National First Prize in the 2024 National University IoT Design Competition[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]Selected for the National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (National Level, rated "Excellent")[cite: 24].
