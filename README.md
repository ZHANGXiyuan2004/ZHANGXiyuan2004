## 📚 Selected Research Projects

### Self-Powered Multimodal Emotion Recognition System
**Lead Researcher** | *Dec 2023 - Aug 2024* | Advisor: Prof. Ding Zheng (UESTC)
- **Project Introduction**: Developed a wearable device integrating voice and EEG signal analysis for emotion detection.
- **Personal Contributions**:
  - **Completed the model architecture**, designed a bimodal binding mechanism to process voice signals, combined modality-invariant and modality-specific features to input into the Transformer; designed a wavelet-transform-based preprocessing method to convert EEG signals into time-frequency image blocks to input into the Vision Transformer.
  - **Prepared flexible organic photovoltaic devices** using PM6:Y6 = 1:1.2 as the organic active layer and ITO-PET as the flexible cathode, achieving a photoelectric conversion efficiency of over 12.39%.
- **Achievements**:
  - First-author paper accepted at ICDT 2025 (Oral Presentation)
  - National First Prize in IoT Design Competition 2024
  - National Innovation Training Program (Excellent Rating)

### Superionic Conductor Materials Screening & Phase Prediction
**Lead Researcher** | *Jan 2025 - May 2025* | Advisor: Prof. Hong Zhu (SJTU)
- **Project Introduction**: Using a small amount of data on superionic conductor materials in the Li-N-S system, the general potential model MatterSim is fine-tuned, and then the fine-tuned model is used to screen the generation model MatterGen to obtain stable materials in the Li-N-S system.
- **Personal Contributions**:
  - **Constructed an active learning loop** to iteratively update the model and data:
  - Used a small amount of labelled superionic conductor material data to train and test MatterSim.
  - Generated unlabelled superionic conductor structures using MatterGen.
  - Loaded MatterSim as a structure prediction model and used the Query By Committee method to obtain its uncertainty.
  - Performed DFT calculations on the data with the highest uncertainty and added it to the training data for the next round of training.
- **Achievement**: Selected for SJTU-Global College Research Internship Program 2025.
